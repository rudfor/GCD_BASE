2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u2/ack_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u2/ack_reg_i_2/O, cell u2/ack_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u2/next_reg_a__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u2/next_reg_a_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u2/next_reg_a_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u2/next_reg_b__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u2/next_reg_b_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell u2/next_reg_b_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u2/next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u2/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[10]_i_1/O, cell u2/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[10]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
